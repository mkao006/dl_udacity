# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: For any pair given in a group, if they have the same 2 possible values (e.g. 23 or 68), then the pair value must be assigned to the twins. If one of the value was assigned to a box not belonging to the twins, this reduces the possible value for the twins to 1 and eliminate the possibility to solve the puzzle.

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: The purpose of constraint propagation is to eliminate options to reduce the number of possibility that we need to evaluate. By adding the addtional diagnoal constraints, we can identify where cases that will not yield a solution. Take the only choice method for example, if the value 1 has already appeared, then for all other box in the diagonal group, this value can be eliminated and reduce the number of path to be evaluated as it would otherwise violate the constraint.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3**.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 
Please try using the environment we provided in the Anaconda lesson of the Nanodegree.

##### Optional: Pygame

Optionally, you can also install pygame if you want to see your visualization. If you've followed our instructions for setting up our conda environment, you should be all set.

If not, please see how to download pygame [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

### Code

* `solution.py` - Fill in the required functions in this file to complete the project.
* `test_solution.py` - You can test your solution by running `python -m unittest`.
* `PySudoku.py` - This is code for visualizing your solution.
* `visualize.py` - This is code for visualizing your solution.

### Visualizing

To visualize your solution, please only assign values to the values_dict using the `assign_value` function provided in solution.py

### Submission
Before submitting your solution to a reviewer, you are required to submit your project to Udacity's Project Assistant, which will provide some initial feedback.  

The setup is simple.  If you have not installed the client tool already, then you may do so with the command `pip install udacity-pa`.  

To submit your code to the project assistant, run `udacity submit` from within the top-level directory of this project.  You will be prompted for a username and password.  If you login using google or facebook, visit [this link](https://project-assistant.udacity.com/auth_tokens/jwt_login) for alternate login instructions.

This process will create a zipfile in your top-level directory named sudoku-<id>.zip.  This is the file that you should submit to the Udacity reviews system.
